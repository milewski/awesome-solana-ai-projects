# Awesome Solana AI Projects

A curated list of amazing Solana-based projects leveraging Artificial Intelligence.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Solana ecosystem often faces FUD caused by meme projects with no real foundation.  
> This list aims to change that by separating the **LEGIT** projects from the **MEME** stuff.   
> Every project here serves a real purpose, provides utility, and isn't just temporary nonsense.
